### Creative Expansion Pack is currently cancelled/on-hold. 

### The mod itself is basically finished and will only be updated if it breaks and that I do care.



## Questions and Answers

How is Creative Expansion Pack made?
> Creative Expansion Pack is made using BepinEx, a modding framework for games made with Unity.

Can I get banned for using Creative Expansion Pack?
> There's no reported case of a user of the mod getting banned during its private state, but the mod's creator has no implication if Mediatonic takes any actions on your account due to using the mod, use it at your own risk! With the whole nature of Fall Guys Creative and the implications of the mod, the question of if you can use Creative Expansion Pack is up to how much you value your account, even tho you are very unlikely of having to go through a ban if you play it safe...

Is Creative Expansion Pack against Fall Guys' EULA?
> After checking, Creative Expansion Pack **seems** to not **explicitly** be against Fall Guys' EULA, this mod doesn't give you a "competitive advantage" over a player playing a legitimate and unmodified copy of the game.â€Ž
>
> However, PLEASE MAKE GOOD USE OF CREATIVE EXPANSION PACK!!! This mod is clearly not a joke and has mad power over Fall Guys Creative, and everyone knows that with great power comes great responsibility.

What features does Creative Expansion Pack include?
> A lot, try it out for yourself!

How do the others scale obstacles?

I can't play normal Fall Guys when Creative Expansion Pack is installed, how to deal with that?!
> You can't, in order to play the normal game you got to uninstall BepinEx, you can do that by using the "Restore_EAC" batch script in your game's root and quickly switch back to the mod by using the "Install_BepinEx" batch script that's in the same folder.
