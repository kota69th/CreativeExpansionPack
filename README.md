With the whole nature of Fall Guys Creative and the implications of the mod, the question of if you can use Creative Expansion Pack is up to how much you value your account, even tho you are very unlikely of having to go through a ban if you play it safe...

Is Creative Expansion Pack against Fall Guys' EULA?

I can't play normal Fall Guys when Creative Expansion Pack is installed, how to deal with that?!
> You can't, in order to play the normal game you got to uninstall BepinEx, you can do that by using the "Restore_EAC" batch script in your game's root and quickly switch back to the mod by using the "Install_BepinEx" batch script that's in the same folder.
